# V6 Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-07

## Current State

- Branch: `v5/fx-replay-workstation`
- Current V6 step state: Step 109 completed.
- Next planned step: Step 110 - Journal Row Action Owner Surface Readiness
  Audit.
- Worktree expectation at handoff: clean.

The latest completed work is Next Dashboard Row Action Exposure Readiness Audit:

- `V6_NEXT_DASHBOARD_ROW_ACTION_EXPOSURE_READINESS_AUDIT.md` documents that no
  hidden dashboard row action is ready to expose yet.
- Journal is the nearest candidate because command surface and persistence are
  ready, but it remains hidden until owner surface and browser coverage are
  ready.
- Order and Calendar remain later candidates because their owner contracts lack
  ready command/persistence paths.

## Restart Reading Order

After restarting the server or assistant context, read these first:

1. `v6/TODO.md`
2. `v6/docs/INDEX.md`
3. `v6/docs/V6_HANDOFF.md`
4. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step103_chart_control_bridge_owner_contract.md`
5. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step104_chart_control_bridge_integration_audit.md`
6. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step105_chart_control_bridge_browser_regression_audit.md`
7. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step106_dashboard_row_action_isolation_reaudit.md`
8. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step107_dashboard_visible_row_action_browser_coverage_audit.md`
9. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step108_dashboard_session_browser_regression_pack_audit.md`
10. `v6/sessions/session_20260707_step109_next_dashboard_row_action_exposure_readiness_audit.md`
11. `v6/docs/V6_DASHBOARD_SESSION_BROWSER_REGRESSION_PACK_AUDIT.md`
12. `v6/docs/V6_NEXT_DASHBOARD_ROW_ACTION_EXPOSURE_READINESS_AUDIT.md`

## Next Step

Step 110 should audit Journal row-action owner surface readiness.

Keep Step 110 bounded:

- keep the Journal row action hidden;
- define the minimum journal-owned surface/browser contract needed before any
  row-action exposure;
- keep Journal isolated from chart, bars, replay, viewport, orders, calendar,
  and session-dashboard runtime control paths;
- do not modify runtime behavior unless the audit exposes a mismatch;
- keep dashboard row action visibility unchanged.

Expected implementation shape:

- add or update focused Journal owner surface readiness documentation/smoke if
  needed;
- keep `journal-contract.js`, row-action boundaries, and browser smokes as the
  source of truth;
- run selected Journal contract and row-action boundary smokes.

## Critical Boundaries

V6 exists because V5 replay viewport/manual-anchor behavior became structurally
unreliable. Do not patch V5 replay behavior as a substitute for V6 work.

Preserve these V6 rules:

- UI dispatches commands and subscribes to events.
- Only chart runtime writes chart series.
- Only bar data runtime requests and caches bars.
- Only replay runtime owns replay cursor and reveal state.
- Creating a replay session must not load a full date range into chart state.
- Dashboard/session metadata work must not become a hidden cross-module control
  path into chart, bars, replay, viewport, orders, journal, or calendar.

For the current Recent Sessions row actions:

- Summary: enabled, read-only metadata-only, owner `session-summary`.
- Stats: enabled, read-only metadata/unavailable metrics, owner
  `session-analytics`.
- Copy: enabled, metadata-only, owner `session-repository`.
- Order: disabled/contract-ready, owner `orders-runtime`.
- Journal: disabled/contract-ready, owner `journal-runtime`.
- Calendar: disabled/contract-ready, owner `calendar-runtime`.

- `node v6/tests/app-shell-browser-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/session-metadata-persistence-browser-smoke.js`

- `node v6/tests/product-baseline-screenshot-smoke.js`
- `git diff --check`

For workstation replay/chart re-entry, select from:

- `node v6/tests/replay-chart-readiness-audit-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/chart-reset-view-browser-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/workstation-native-manual-wall-input-browser-smoke.js`

- `node v6/tests/workstation-default-wall-flow-browser-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/workstation-manual-wall-flow-browser-smoke.js`

Browser tests should be run sequentially because they share browser/debug-server
resources. If a browser smoke fails with `listen EPERM: 127.0.0.1`, rerun the
same command with approved escalation.

## Server Restart Note

Restarting the API/HTML service should not require code changes. After restart,
verify the service state with the normal local V6 page and continue from Step
110. The handoff point is intentionally before any hidden dashboard row action
is exposed.
