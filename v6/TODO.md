# V6 TODO

## Current / Next

- Current status: V6 opened because V5 replay viewport/manual-anchor behavior
  proved structurally unreliable. The active decision is documented in
  `v5/docs/specs/v6-rewrite-start-decision.md`.
- Current direction: do not patch V5 replay viewport behavior further. Build V6
  around `v6/docs/specs/replay-viewport-intent.md`,
  `v6/docs/specs/replay-visible-latency.md`,
  `v6/docs/specs/pane-model.md`, and
  `v6/docs/specs/fxreplay-baseline.md`.
- Execution plan: follow `v6/docs/V6_EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md`. The roadmap expands
  the V5 formation order into smaller V6 gates and moves the known V5 failure
  classes, visible K-line delay and primary/non-primary multi-pane confusion,
  into early stop conditions.
- Latest completed step: Step 5 - Replay Runtime. The implementation adds
  replay session loading, cursor/revealed state, Next/Play/Pause/Reset, and
  no-future replay progression without chart/bar-data/viewport coupling.

## Next Executable Steps

### Step 6 - Unified Pane Model

Implement the first pane record shape, default pane id, active pane id, and
static audit against primary/non-primary stores.

Acceptance:

- single pane uses the same model future panes use;
- no `primaryState` / `secondaryState` style split exists.

## Completed Steps

### Step 1 - Skeleton And Contracts

Completed in commits:

- `8e44281 feat(v6): scaffold workstation shell`
- `5ca0d75 feat(v6): add runtime core`
- `98847cb test(v6): add step one smoke gates`

Verification:

- `node v6/tests/runtime-core-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/boundary-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/app-shell-browser-smoke.js`
- `git diff --check`

### Step 2 - Product Baseline Shell

Completed in commits:

- `6c2611a feat(v6): expand workstation shell markup`

- `git diff --check`

### Step 3 - Session Model

Completed in commits:

- `dfd4ed5 feat(v6): add session domain repository`
- `9f6cd8a feat(v6): register session runtime`
- `8b80d4e test(v6): gate session runtime boundary`

Verification:

- `node v6/tests/session-domain-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/session-runtime-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/runtime-core-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/boundary-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/app-shell-browser-smoke.js`
- `git diff --check`

### Step 4 - Bar Data Runtime

Completed in commits:

- `a790062 feat(v6): add bar data window cache`
- `7693073 feat(v6): add v4 bars adapter`
- `dc7f958 feat(v6): register bar data runtime`
- `a853113 test(v6): gate bar data runtime`

Verification:

- `node v6/tests/bar-data-domain-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/bar-data-adapter-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/bar-data-runtime-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/runtime-core-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/boundary-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/app-shell-browser-smoke.js`
- `git diff --check`

### Step 5 - Replay Runtime

Completed in commits:

- `0b246d8 feat(v6): add replay state domain`
- `602d6b7 feat(v6): register replay runtime`
- `7150114 test(v6): gate replay runtime`

Verification:

- `node v6/tests/replay-domain-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/replay-runtime-smoke.js`

- `node v6/tests/boundary-smoke.js`
- `node v6/tests/app-shell-browser-smoke.js`
- `git diff --check`

## Deferred Until Step 6 Passes

- multi-pane layout;
- Settings parity;
- transport polish beyond the FXReplay baseline controls;
- persistence beyond in-memory session state;
- journal/orders/analytics;
- visual polish.

## V5 Reference Policy

Allowed from V5:

- product wording and workflow lessons;
- stable V4 API usage;
- test fixture data generation;
- selected UI layout ideas after Step 6 passes.
- FXReplay-like interaction targets from specs, not V5 implementation paths.

Forbidden from V5:

- chart runtime viewport/follow/manual internals;
- replay display-window viewport restoration model;
- viewport-demand bridge ownership;
- manual anchor patches based on time range plus logical reconstruction;
- route-level orchestration that couples cursor, data loading, and chart range
  writes.
- primary/non-primary split mechanisms.
- any replay path that updates runtime cursor quickly but delays visible candle
  appearance without failing a browser latency gate.
