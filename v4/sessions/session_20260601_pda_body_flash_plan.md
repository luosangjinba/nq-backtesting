# 2026-06-01 PDA Body Locate Flash Plan

## Context

- User reported that current linked PDA locate flash is calculated from time only, so the target body is not clear enough.
- Decision: do not implement immediately during discussion; first commit current linked-ref locate UI, then record the implementation plan.
- Current committed baseline:
  - `af9f541 feat(v4): locate linked reason refs`
  - Reasons linked refs now have a Locate action.
  - Locate currently moves to the linked PDA/Segment time range and uses the existing vertical time-range flash.
  - Ref remove `X` now uses a compact Execution-style button.

## Design Decision

Separate the behavior into two layers:

- Locate: move the chart viewport near the referenced object.
- Flash: highlight the actual object body when possible.

The existing time-range flash remains useful as fallback, but it should not be the primary visual for linked PDA refs.

Preferred implementation path:

- Add a dedicated PDA body flash primitive first.
- Avoid changing the normal PDA renderer state machine unless the primitive approach proves too limited.
- Support the common PDA geometries incrementally.

## Planned Steps

### Step 175: PDA Body Flash Design Closeout

- Define a small API such as `flashPdaAnnotation(annotation, context)` or chart-specific wrappers.
- Return `true` when a body flash was drawn, `false` when caller should fallback to time-range flash.
- Keep behavior non-persistent and visual-only.
- Do not write to PDA store, selection state, order review state, or localStorage.

### Step 176: Range PDA Body Flash Primitive

- Add `v4/src/chart/pda-locate-flash-primitive.js`.
- First support range-style PDA:
  - FVG / IFVG
  - OB / Breaker
  - NDOG / NWOG
  - any annotation with usable `startTimeTimestamp/endTimeTimestamp` or equivalent render times plus `topPrice/bottomPrice`.
- Draw pulse overlay over the actual rectangle:
  - x from start/end time
  - y from top/bottom price
  - translucent fill
  - bright border
  - short duration matching current locate flash feel.

### Step 177: Other PDA Shapes

- Add support for:
  - liquidity line / key level: flash the horizontal line at the PDA price across its rendered time span.
  - point-set: flash each marker and the reference line.
  - fib: flash main fib anchor line or the fib bounding span.
- Any unsupported or partially missing geometry should return `false`, not throw.

### Step 178: Wire Reasons Linked PDA Locate

- In `order-review-actions.js`, linked PDA Locate should:
  - resolve annotation by ref id,
  - choose primary or secondary chart using `sourceChartId`,
  - move viewport to the object time range,
  - attempt PDA body flash,
  - fallback to existing time-range flash if body flash is unavailable.
- Linked Segment can stay on the current time-range flash path for now.

### Step 179: Validation and Closeout

- Browser/manual checks:
  - Reason linked FVG/OB flashes the rectangle body.
  - Reason linked BSL/SSL flashes line body.
  - Secondary chart PDA ref flashes on secondary when Split is enabled.
  - Secondary ref gives a clear status error or primary fallback when Split is disabled.
  - Unsupported geometry falls back to time-range flash.
- Technical checks:
  - full `v4/src/**/*.js` syntax check
  - `git diff --check`
  - Web `8001/index.html` smoke
  - API `/v4/health` smoke

## Boundaries

- No automatic selection change when locating.
- No persisted state changes.
- No broad PDA renderer refactor in the first pass.
- No change to Replay History behavior.
