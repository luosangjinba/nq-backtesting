Human-accepted on 2026-07-20:

- professional local-first Session list and selected-Session surfaces;
- accessible Create Session dialog with compact NQ/ES multi-select dropdown;
- every dialog open starts from a fully empty draft with no prior-form bleed;

- activate exactly one accepted cursor/revision owner per Session activation;
- keep proposals inert until `commitVisible` confirms the workspace result;
- reject cross-Session, cross-activation, foreign, rejected, and stale proposals;
- preserve the accepted cursor when a proposal is rejected or superseded;
- keep Manual and Auto inputs on the same proposal/commit path;
- add no scheduler, bar I/O, projection, chart, viewport, persistence, or UI.

## R4.2 Pure Projection Domain — Completed

R4.2 completed with automated evidence; no interaction or visual review is required:

- consume immutable Raw Bar Batches and one branded Replay proposal;
- require common provider/instrument/source-resolution/dataset identity across
  ordered, non-overlapping source windows;
- apply exclusive Replay no-future filtering before Session Hours eligibility
  and aggregation;
- preserve every eligible intermediate source bar in the identity `1m` fixture;

- pin official Lightweight Charts `5.2.0` without copying V6 runtime code;
- isolate every chart API call in one replaceable adapter;
- prove actual candle pixels after two rendering opportunities before exact
  adapter receipt and workspace/Replay acceptance;
- compose one NQ/`1m`/ETH deterministic local foundation workspace through
  Session, Bar Data, Replay, Projection, Workspace Transaction, Chart Snapshot,
  Viewport, and adapter public ports;
- show 120 source minutes of historical prefix plus the selected Session start
  bar on entry, and reveal one additional eligible source bar per Manual Next
  without future bars;
- preserve native drag-created manual offset/span through the next snapshot and
  restore default wall only through Reset View;
- provide professional chart-first loading, empty, unavailable, stale, error,
  and ready surfaces with keyboard-visible controls and responsive layout;

  negative controls, cache-hit maximum, and a fixed `1440x900` visual fixture.

The first human review rejected the fixed-size chart card, artificial-looking
bar fixture, oversized actions, and centered Manual Next overlay. The corrective
pass delivered an immersive chart route, denser varied candles,
compact actions, no stale-state chart cover, exact NQ quarter-tick OHLC, and
bounded low-frequency wick spikes.

Human-accepted on 2026-07-20 after re-review of real chart interaction, wall
behavior, visible settlement, perceived latency, and visual quality.

## R5.1 V6 Interaction Decision Carry-Forward — Complete

Settled V6 interaction decisions for Reset View, Replay transport, Chart
Settings, multi-pane, ETH/RTH, and multi-instrument behavior now carry forward
as binding V7 product evidence. V7 does not repeat the product interview unless
a recorded reopen trigger applies. Implementation ownership, atomicity, stale
rejection, persistence, and executable proof are re-derived in V7.

## R5.2 Session Hours/Calendar Domain — Completed

Completed with automated evidence; no interaction or visual review is required:

- verify actual NQ/ES DuckDB timestamps are exchange-wall-clock labels encoded
  as UTC-like epochs and forbid a second timezone conversion;
- implement immutable weekly ETH/RTH schedules and versioned, sourced,
  verified date exceptions;
- preserve unknown/missing source truth instead of inferring a closure;
- expose Projection-compatible eligibility plus source-backed visible-through
  and next/previous traversal without owning Replay;
- cover NQ/ES, DST, weekend, maintenance, holiday, early close, exclusive
  cursor, immutable output, and negative controls;
- add no toolbar, Replay mutation, Bar Data I/O, chart mutation, persistence,
  multi-pane, or multi-instrument runtime.

## R5.3 Fixed-Duration Timeframe Projection — Completed

Completed with automated evidence; no interaction or visual review is required:

- confirm Lightweight Charts consumes ordered prepared data and does not own
  source-to-display aggregation;
- implement registered fixed-duration policy ports with immutable OHLCV output;
- use one canonical Unix/clock bucket formula with a configuration offset and
  no Session/Replay/request-window origin drift;
- preserve V6's accepted whole-hour and offset four-hour grids without concrete
  timeframe-id branches;
- prove Session Hours eligibility precedes aggregation, partial active buckets
  remain exclusive-no-future, gaps are not synthesized, and unknown volume
  remains unknown;
- prove independently immutable policy instances and reject a stale policy id
  against a newly selected timeframe definition;
- add no toolbar, runtime switch mutation, multi-pane, real provider, or
  calendar day/week/month aggregation.

## R5.4 Atomic Timeframe/Session-Hours Replacement — Completed

Completed with automated evidence; no interaction or visual review is required:

- resolve registered instrument/timeframe/Session Hours policy combinations
  without concrete capability-id branches;
- route both replacement operations through the existing Workspace Transaction
  Runtime and exact visible-completion gate;
- add branded Replay retention proposals that advance revision without moving
  the source cursor;
- record explicit Session Hours mode and real source-level visible-through in
  Projection provenance;
- prove ETH→RTH retains Tuesday `03:01` cursor while visible-through becomes
  Monday `16:14`, including RTH `1h` `09:30`-anchored aggregation;
- preserve the last accepted workspace, visible snapshot, cursor,
  visible-through, and revisions on failure;
- reject delayed/superseded acquisition and presentation with zero side
  effects;
- add no toolbar, multi-pane, real provider, persistence, or playback timer.

## R5.5 Compact Timeframe And ETH/RTH Controls — Awaiting Human Acceptance

Implemented with automated evidence:

- register the V6 fixed minute/hour set from `1m` through `12h` × ETH/RTH;
- render one grouped TF dropdown by default and keep unsupported session-aware
  `1D`/`1W`/`1M` entries explicitly disabled;
- dispatch compact controls through the R5.4 replacement transaction and sync
  active state only from its accepted Workspace snapshot;
- retain the Replay cursor and manual/default wall across replacements;
- keep the accepted chart visible during cache-hit refresh and replacement
  errors, using only bounded inline status;
- prove real-browser timeframe and Session Hours projection, compact sizing,
  no centered update overlay, manual-wall preservation, and Reset View;
- update the intentional `1440x900` visual fixture.
- keep the Session, instrument, TF, ETH/RTH, Reset, and Next bar controls on one
  desktop toolbar row;
- use the V6 entry baseline: 120 minutes of earlier context plus the selected
  start bar, with every future bar hidden until Next bar;
- load bounded older history whenever manual browsing reaches the left edge,
  preserving Replay and allowing repeated extension.

The first review's mixed local/UTC chart labels and no-visible-change Friday
Next are corrected. The chart now shares the Session card's browser-local
clock, and Next reveals the next eligible ETH/RTH source minute across excluded
calendar gaps using a bounded expanded request.
The workspace also distinguishes the full Session range from the Replay cursor
and current source visible-through; the Session end is a no-future advancement
limit, not an initially visible candle.
The follow-up review's date-independent `01:59 PM` cutoff is corrected by
removing forward-context entry entirely. The selected start is the first Replay
bar; earlier bars are context and later bars remain hidden.

Exact next action: human visual and interaction review of R5.5. Do not begin R6
multi-pane or real-provider work until this gate is accepted.
